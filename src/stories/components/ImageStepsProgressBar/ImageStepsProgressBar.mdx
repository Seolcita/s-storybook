## Overview

ImageStepsProgressBar is a visual representation of a user's progress through a sequence of steps. It uses images to represent each step, providing a more engaging and intuitive user experience. The currentStep prop determines which step is currently active, highlighting it to indicate the user's position in the sequence. This component is useful in scenarios such as tutorials, walkthroughs, or multi-step forms where tracking progress is important.
