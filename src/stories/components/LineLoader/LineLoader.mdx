## Overview

The LineLoader component is a visual indicator used to represent the loading state of a component or page. It displays a horizontal line that animates to show that a process is ongoing when the outcome or completion time is unknown. The LineLoader comes in different sizes, such as Small and Large, which can be used depending on the space available or the visual impact desired. This component is useful in maintaining user engagement during potentially long or uncertain wait times.
