## Overview

The Select component is a form control that allows users to choose one option from a list. It's commonly used when there are more than a few options to choose from. The Select component can be customized with different properties such as fullWidth to make it span the full width of its parent, width to specify its width, and color to change its color. Variants include Single Select for choosing one option and Full Width for a wider visual presence. This component is essential for collecting user input in forms.
